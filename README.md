# movie-recommender-system

This a Machine learning project in which I have written an Algorithm that we take a movie name as input and Suggest five Movie names which are of the same type which a view might also like if he/she have liked the movie they have currently watched.

The steps to run this project are:
1) At first, fork the repository to your own github and then clone the repository in to our local machine.
2) Then you go ahead and open the Recommender-system.ipynb file in juypter Notebook and run all the instructions one by one
3) In the directory where you have cloned the repository you'll also find a file called "app.py", go ahead and open the file in any ide or text editior and install all the dependencies/libraries and the name of all those libraries is provided in "requirements.txt" file
4) Then finally open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you have you're "app.py" file and go ahead and type command "streamlit run app.py" and the new tab will automatically open in your web browser where you can try the app.

This app has also been deployed on heroku, so you can also try the app in the link: https://stream-flix-recommender-system.herokuapp.com/
